we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.<br> 
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars;<br> 
other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. <br> 
Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. <br> 
This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch<br>
